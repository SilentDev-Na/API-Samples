# API-Samples
A personal collection of API projects and experiments I’ve built while learning and exploring C#.  Here, I share every API I create, along with practical examples and lessons I’ve picked up along the way.  Think of this as my playground for experimenting, practicing, and documenting my journey with APIs.
