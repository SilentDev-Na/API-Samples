Welcome to **APIs Samples**!  

This repository is my **personal playground** for building, experimenting, and learning about APIs using C#.  
Here, I will share **all the API projects I create**, along with **practical examples** and **lessons I learn** along the way.  
Think of this repo as a **living collection of my API experiments and learning journey**.
